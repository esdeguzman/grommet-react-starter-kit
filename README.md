# Getting Started with Grommet using React

This is a template created by following the [**Grommer Starter - New App**](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-starter-new-app)

This template is created up to the [**Add Tip**](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-starter-new-app#add-tip) portion of the installation.

It uses the style-components version ^5.3.11 as version 6 is incompatible in grommet version ^2.33.1

---

## Getting Started

Just clone this repo and install its dependencies, cd into the folder and start like your normal React app.

```bash
npm install
cd grommet-react-stater-kit
```

```bash
npm start
```
